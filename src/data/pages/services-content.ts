        "When the business buys the building it trades from, the lending test is <strong>EBITDA cover</strong>, trading profit measured against the monthly mortgage payment, with a typical comfort threshold of 1.3–1.5×. This is the dental partnership taking the OX17 surgery freehold off a retiring principal; the accountancy firm converting a Westgate lease into a floor purchase; the engineering business buying its Cowley trade-counter unit off the landlord. Two years of clean filed accounts is the standard minimum. LTV runs to <strong>75%</strong>, deposits of 25–30% are typically funded from accumulated retained profit (and occasionally capital-released equity from a director's home).",
        '<strong>Allica Bank</strong>, <strong>Shawbrook</strong>, HTB (dedicated Oxford office), Cambridge & Counties and <strong>Cynergy Bank</strong> sit at the sweet spot for owner-occupier lending. <strong>Lloyds</strong> commercial banking, <strong>NatWest</strong> Cornmarket, <strong>Barclays</strong> High Street and <strong>Santander</strong> price competitively where the covenant is strong and the sector is mainstream. Mid-2026 interest rates: <strong>6.0–7.5% pa</strong>. Term length is the lever that materially changes affordability, extending repayment from 15 to 20 years frequently clears the EBITDA test where rate alone will not. Owner-occupier sits outside FCA regulation in most cases (it is a business borrowing for business premises, not a residential mortgage).',

      paragraphs: [
        'A commercial investment mortgage is long-term debt against a let property held as an income-producing asset. The borrower is usually a limited company SPV, an LLP, or an individual investor; the security is the building; the affordability test is rent against the cost of borrowing. The headline metric is <strong>ICR (interest cover ratio)</strong>, gross rent divided by interest cost, typically required at <strong>140–160%</strong> stressed at a notional rate 1–2% above pay rate. Some lenders also test <strong>DSCR</strong> on a fully-amortising basis at 130–145% cover. LTVs of 65–75% are standard for income-producing assets with a clear lease.',
        'Tenant covenant and lease length carry as much weight as LTV. A 10-year unbroken FRI lease to a national covenant on a Westgate office prices materially better than three two-year leases to local independents on a secondary parade. <strong>NatWest</strong>, <strong>Lloyds</strong>, <strong>Barclays</strong> and <strong>Santander</strong> compete hard on prime single-asset investment; <strong>Shawbrook</strong>, <strong>InterBay Commercial</strong>, <strong>LendInvest</strong> and Together cover the trickier end (multi-let, short-WAULT, semi-commercial, vacant-with-refurb).

        'Commercial remortgage covers two distinct moments. End of a typical 5-year fix maturing into a different rate environment; or capital-raise refinancing that releases equity from a property that has appreciated since the original draw. With Bank of England base-rate trajectory through 2026 looking flatter than the 2023–24 cycle, refinancing demand into Oxford is strong, particularly on assets bought 2019–2021 where current valuations support a meaningfully better LTV than the original facility.',

If you are inside an ERC window, the maths often still works, saving 1.5% on rate over a fresh five-year term outweighs an ERC of 3% of redemption on most £1M+ facilities.

        'A second-charge commercial mortgage sits behind your existing first-charge facility, secured against the same property. The senior lender retains priority; the second-charge lender takes a subordinated position. You keep the existing first-charge interest rate intact (and avoid breaking ERCs) while raising additional debt against the same security.

        'It is a niche product but the right answer when the alternative is breaking a 4% legacy fix to consolidate at 7.5%.
